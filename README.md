Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
Did data preprocessing, feature selection based on correlation with target variable and feature engineering.
Removed outliers from numerical columns basis the box plot. Only keeping the values betwwen the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile.
Applied log normal transformation to ensure that the feature variables are normally distributed. 
Label encoded the categorical variables 
Applied various Machine Learning algorithms on the model and evaluated their r2 score.
Did hyperparameter tuning and tried to better the r2 score and decrease the root mean squarred error.
